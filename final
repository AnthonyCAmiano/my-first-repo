Final Project Title: 
Elect John Doe to the Westchester County Board of Legislators

Final Project Description: 
Using my political experience, I will attempt to create a website for a political newcomer, John Doe, who is running for a legislative seat on the Westchester County Board. I will promote John through various tabs on the Home Page, including "About the Candidate," "Johnâ€™s Plan," "News," "Events," and a "Sign Up/Donate" page. There should be pictures of John and an infusion of his various social media from Facebook and Twitter to Flickr and LinkedIn on the site. In general, the site should invite voters to return for updates, posts, interesting/relevant content from both the candidate and the staff as a way to stay informed of election developments. The end goal of the site is to establish a positive image of John for the voters to see in hopes of persuading them that he is the best candidate to represent them on the board.
